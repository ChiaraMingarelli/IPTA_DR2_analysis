# IPTA DR2 analysis

Resources for IPTA DR2 "lite" analysis.
Started during the IPTA Hack Week, New York 2017.

Use `gen_partim.ipynb` to produce cleaned and filtered `.par` and `.tim` files.
These can then be used with any GW or noise analysis.
`gwb_FoM.ipynb` and `bwm_FoM.ipynb` demonstrate data selection using a *figure of merit*.

Some `enterprise` tools are provided here,
but you are better off using the most up to date [enterprise extensions](https://github.com/stevertaylor/enterprise_extensions).
